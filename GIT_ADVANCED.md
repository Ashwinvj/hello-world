- Git merge- helps in merging the branches after the codes are corrected in each branch so that the masster would be free of bugs.
- Git revert-this helps in the undo of commit without deleting the commit which has been previously done and just by giving an another commit for the undo process
- Git rebase- is an alternative to merge command.This would integrate changes from one branch to other
- Git dif-this command helps to get output for two different input sets
 
 
 Create new branch based on existing one. New branch will be only local for now.
